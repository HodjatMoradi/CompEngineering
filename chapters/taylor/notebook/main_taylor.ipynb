    "The solution to a physical model is usually a function. The function could describe the temperature evolution of the earth, it could be growth of cancer cells, the water pressure in an oil reservoir, the list is endless. If we can solve the model analytically, the answer is given in terms of a continuous function. Most of the models cannot be solved analytically, then we have to rely on computers to help us. The computer does not have any concept of continuous functions, a function is always evaluated at some point in space and/or time. Assume for simplicity that the solution to our problem is $f(x)=\\sin x$, and we would like to visualize the solution. How many points do we need in our plot to approximate the true function? \n",
