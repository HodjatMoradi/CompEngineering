    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to gain further insight into zombie outbreaks\n",
    "by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Previously, we studied the spreading\n",
    "of diseases with *compartment models*. Key parameters in this approach\n",
    "are the probability of infection $\\beta$, and the recovery rate\n",
    "$\\alpha$ (kill rate for zombies). Together these two parameters were used\n",
    "to estimate the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$, which provides\n",
    "a measure of whether the disease will be able to spread in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In project 3, we simply assumed that $\\beta$ declined exponentially as a\n",
    "function of time, eventually putting an end to the disease outbreak.\n",
    "However, we did not explain *why* such a rapid decline should occur, if at all.\n",
    "For the particular case of the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Liberia,\n",
    "researchers actually found that the value of $\\mathcal{R}_0$ showed no\n",
    "signs of decreasing, even 6 months after the outbreak [[althaus2014]](#althaus2014).\n",
    "Understanding the mechanisms for how to decrease $\\beta$ is therefore\n",
    "important when faced with a potential epidemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the above statement more concrete, we will in this project model\n",
    "*interactions* between sick and healthy persons *directly*. In this way we\n",
    "can test various assumptions, and predict how $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ might\n",
    "vary as a function of time. To this end, we shall employ\n",
    "*random walk* [[pearson1905problem;@codling2008random]](#pearson1905problem;@codling2008random)\n",
    "simulations.\n",
    "We will start by solving the $SZ$ model using a Monte Carlo approach.\n",
    "Here, we will not learn anything new regarding zombie-human interactions,\n",
    "because we are solving the same model as in project 3. However, you will\n",
    "discover a completely different way of solving the compartment model, and\n",
    "gain an appreciation for how random fluctuations can affect the final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we model detailed interactions between individuals in the population\n",
    "using a random walk method. Based on the output from these simulations, we\n",
    "predict the parameter $\\beta$ from the compartment model as a function of time,\n",
    "which we subsequently compare with the original $SZ$ model.\n",
    "We also investigate the impact of various model assumptions regarding how\n",
    "humans learn from surviving zombie encounters.\n",

This way you make it absolutely clear to people reading your code that it is going to be treated like a global variable.\n",
