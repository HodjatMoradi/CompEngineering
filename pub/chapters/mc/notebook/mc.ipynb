    "1. Random number generators are generally of two types: *hardware random number generator* (HRNG) or *pseudo random number generator* (PRNG).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. HRNG uses a physical process to generate random numbers, this could atmospheric noise, radioactive decay, microscopic fluctuations, which is translated to an electrical signal. The electrical signal is converted to a digital number (1 or 0), by sampling the random signal random numbers can be generated. The HRNG are often named *true random number generators*, and their main use are in *cryptography*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PRNG uses a mathematical algorithm to generate an (apparent) random sequence. The algorithm uses an initial number, or a *seed*,  to start the sequence of random number. The sequence is deterministic, and it will generate the same sequence of numbers if the same seed is used. At some point the algorithm will reproduce itself, i.e. it will have certain period. For some seeds the period may be much shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Many of the PRNG are not considered to be cryptographically secure, because if a sufficiently long sequence of random numbers are generated from them, the rest of the sequence can be predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Python uses the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) algorithm to generate random numbers, and has a period of $2^{19937}âˆ’1\\simeq4.3\\cdot10^{6001}$. It is not considered to be cryptographically secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pythons `random.uniform` function, a random seed is chosen each time the code is run, but\n",
    "if we set e.g. `random.seed(2)`, the code will generate the same sequence of numbers each time it is called. \n",

    "## Errors on Monte Carlo Integration and the Binomial Distribution\n",
    "How many rocks do we need to throw in order to reach a certain accuracy? To answer this question we need some results from statistics. Our problem of calculating the integral is closely related to the *binomial distribution*. When we throw a rock one of two things can happen i) the rock falls into the water, or ii) it falls outside the pond. If we denote the probability that the rock falls into the pond as $p$, then the probability that it falls outside the pond, $q$, has to be $q=1-p$.\n",
