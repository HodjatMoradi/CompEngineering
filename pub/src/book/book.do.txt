__Summary.__
(Work in Progress) The purpose of this document is to explain how computers solve mathematical models.
Many of the most common numerical methods is presented, we show how to implement them in Python, and discuss the limitations.
The mathemathical formalism is kept to a minimum. All the material is available at
"github":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering". For each of the chapter there is a Jupyter "notebook":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/pub/chapters". This makes it possible to run all the codes in this document.
We strongly recommend to install Python from "Anaconda":"https://www.anaconda.com/". All documents have been prepared using "doconce":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/pub/chapters".
