Study guides (slides for lectures) 

The study guides are summaries of the main points in the course material. The guides are made such that they can be used as slides in lectures.











The PDF files are based on LaTeX and seldom have technical failures that cannot be easily corrected. The HTML-based files, however, apply MathJax for rendering LaTeX formulas, and sometimes this technology gives rise to unexpected failures (g., incorrect rendering in a web page despite correct LaTeX syntax in the formula). Consult the corresponding PDF file if you find missing or incorrectly rendered formulas in HTML or Sphinx files.
